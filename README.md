CapUnfriendly - Inspired by the late CapFriendly website

Ice hockey statistics project using React and MySQL
A side project so I can learn some more front end skills seeing as we don't go over those much in class.
Also want to actually make a functioning website. Pardon my horrible CSS, graphic design is not my passion.
